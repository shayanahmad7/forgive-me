# Forgive Me - Interactive Apology Website
https://calico-secret-pisces.glitch.me/

## Overview
"Forgive Me" is a playful and heartwarming web application designed to offer a unique and cute way of asking for forgiveness. Inspired by the idea of making amends in a light-hearted manner, this project creates an interactive experience where users are presented with a charming animated scene of one character asking another for forgiveness.

## Concept
The core idea revolves around the theme of apology and forgiveness. The main feature of this application is an interactive "No" button that playfully evades the cursor, making it impossible to decline the apology. The user is then gently nudged towards accepting the apology by clicking on the "Yes" button. Upon acceptance, the page transitions to a delightful scene where the characters joyously embrace, symbolizing forgiveness and reconciliation.

## Features
- Interactive "No" button that moves away when hovered over, adding a playful challenge to the experience.
- A "Yes" button that, when clicked, leads to a cheerful "Yay!" page, complete with a cute emoji where one character hugs the other, symbolizing the acceptance of the apology.
- Engaging animations and graphics that bring the theme of forgiveness to life.
- A responsive design that works well on both desktop and mobile devices.
